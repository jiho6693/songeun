      <h2>Jiho Park</h2>
      
Becoming the representative of Gangnam Pavilion—someone had to take that role—Jiho Park became an example of soft leadership that bent and guided everyone.

When Kim Seeun, carrying a large painting from Turn Depot to Under Depot, had slipped her winter boots on without pulling them up, Jiho Park, the representative, quickly caught up with her, pulled up the boot’s collar, and tucked it on properly. Kim Seeun, startled—it was the very first day they met. A short distance, but on the dirt ground of a park covered in snow. A representative shouldering the heavy responsibility of safety. Jiho Park’s eyes scanned down to the very last detail, making sure nothing strayed from what had been agreed upon. If someone’s hand on a tool faltered, or the way they carried an artwork looked unstable, Jiho would dart in like an arrow.

In 2019, at Team Depot, Jiho Park saw Hong Seung-hye’s We All in the Love Your Depot storage.
 “Ah, it’s beautiful. So cute.”

 The children, she called them a choir, were stacked side by side in the hallway outside Hong’s faculty office. “I told her I could store them for five months, and she said—once this exhibition ends, could I dispose of them? They’ve already been shown three times, so maybe it’s time to let them go.”

 Interested in the process—the system—of artwork disposal, Jiho couldn’t bring himself to just send them off. He must have thought they needed one last dance. “How romantic.”

 “A waltz, a waltz.” The type of dance was already decided, and I was taken aback. But since he was so determined, I called Hong Seung-hye first. Meanwhile, Jiho was already making the Team Depot members practice the waltz—relentlessly.

 Hong’s answer was yes.

 But we didn’t have the budget to build supporting platforms to carry each of the thirty-six children, the choir. The deinstallation happened during the COVID period, so the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art was completely empty. We split the choir between a large blue cart the museum had and a gray standing cart I owned, and somehow, we danced. It wasn’t exactly a waltz for each one, more like a folk dance done in a line. Still, Jiho put on a suit, and Donghyun wrapped a scarf, and they danced for a long while, full of spirit. “A goodbye dance.”

 The next day—the very last day of deinstallation—Hong called. “A friend will take them in for the time being.” We all felt saved, relieved that it wasn’t our hands that had to throw away We All.
