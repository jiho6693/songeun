      <h2>Sueyon Hwang</h2>
<p>We carefully lifted the paper faces of Hwang Soo-yeon, which had been resting quietly, filling the studio table (or shelves), loaded them onto a cart, and carried them one by one in a line.
 
We created a setup that introduced each paper face differently, and determined the duration of their appearance through the performers’ movements.

When she was younger, Hwang Soo-yeon would cut yellow rubber bands into ever smaller pieces until they could no longer be divided, piling them high.

She crumpled aluminum foil, hammered and hammered it, until it became a lump large enough to hold to her chest.

A persistent act of altering the inherent nature of a material.
Deepest care.

I was always amazed at how Hwang Soo-yeon used the folds of paper as a framework to create those intricate curves.
 
Even in simpler forms, I was fascinated by the way she divided the surfaces.
