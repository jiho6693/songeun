      <h2>Henk Visch – Plywood</h2>
      
Henk Visch was the first person to collect my work. The Dutch sculptor Henk said without hesitation, with a laugh, “I’m a successful artist. My first solo show sold out, so I just kept going.”

He lived in a huge warehouse and drove a very old car, but he bought works from young artists to encourage them, filling his home and studio—once a Coca-Cola warehouse—with art. A few years ago, he even registered www.huishenkvisch.eu as a museum.

In 2005, riding his bicycle through the alleys of Sordan in Amsterdam, Henk happened to see my work through a lit gallery window. That ridiculous toilet—the one I had roughly tied together with hoses, quickly wrapped with white cloth, and casually called a toilet—Henk asked how much it was.

I told him I couldn’t sell it. Henk said he was like a child, he simply had to have what he wanted. “No, what amazes me is that you could make a work like that. Others wouldn’t even think of it as art, but you didn’t care. You went ahead anyway. That inspired me, so I have to buy it.”

I thought, “Ah, whatever,” and quoted a high price, just to see if he would still buy it. Henk said, “For a beginner, this is expensive, but I’ll buy it without bargaining. Still, for a young artist, it’s better to let the prices rise gradually than to start high.”

At that time, I felt uncomfortable with the idea of “selling” a work. And to think I was selling something so provisional—a structure that would unravel as soon as it came down from the wall. I was very confused, but ultimately, led by Henk Visch’s wide, confident eyes, I sold it.

Afterward, I received a message from Henk: “Your toilet isn’t fixed—could you secure it?” I visited his studio in Eindhoven and put the finishing touches on that temporary free-form piece, fixing the shape of the toilet with wire.

Henk continued to buy my works every year or two. Whenever I had an exhibition, he would casually appear—sometimes in Germany, sometimes in the UK.

Around that time, even though I was doing so many exhibitions and taking so many flights, I didn’t know what, if anything, was improving beyond the exhaustion. I felt miserable and withdrawn. “Maybe it’s time to quit…”

That day, Henk arrived at my Düsseldorf solo exhibition in his old car. With his characteristic wide-eyed look, he delighted, “Jewyo, how can you make something like this? Amazing, truly amazing.” Just like a child…

For lunch, we ate sushi rolls in the basement of a shopping center. Seeing me exhausted, Henk said warmly, “Jewyo, you should be old as an artist. You must grow old as an artist.”

I asked if that would make me very different from who I was then. Henk said, “There are things an artist can only understand by aging as an artist. To miss that is foolish.”

So I have held onto his words and have been steadily growing older. As an artist.
