      <h2>Woo-kyung Jeon</h2>
      
The studio was small, so when I told Woo-kyung that I could take on one large piece for safekeeping, he brought Sculpture Looking at Sculpture.

Seated in the passenger seat of the car with a seatbelt fastened, the sculpture arrived at Turn Depot and from the very beginning occupied the very top tier of the storage racks, where for three and a half years it looked down on the works inside, and on the people who came to look at them.

Originally, I heard, a CCTV camera had been attached to its arm-like part, making it Sculpture Watching Sculpture. But for reasons of battery and technical limitations, that function was removed. Whether it was sculpture looking at sculpture or sculpture watching sculpture, I couldn’t help but laugh at that endless talk of sculpture. I liked its rough finish, its slanted, uncomfortable posture.

Especially the sight of Jeon Woo-kyung, wrapping one arm around the piece and carrying it with ease…

In 2018, in a class called New Form, Jeon Woo-kyung presented a performance/exercise I had never seen before. The costume, the movements, the backdrop for the recording, all of it was strange. “Where did this person come from…?” I wondered, and the curiosity lingered. Two years later, out of the blue, I reached out.

I asked after him during the COVID days, and when Gangnam Pavilion 2020 began, I told him he could entrust me with one large work. And so Sculpture Looking at Sculpture came, tucked under Jeon Woo-kyung’s arm.
