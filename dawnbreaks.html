      <h2>Dasle Seok</h2>
<p>Seok Da-seul’s tangerine peel work became the most complained-about piece at Gangnam Pavilion, and in the end was returned to the artist. The Culture City Division at Gangnam District Office, besieged by calls asking why trash was being left unattended, asked me to take it away.

At Gangnam Pavilion, ‘Turn Depot’ was for tangibles, and ‘Under Depot’ for digital images. Since Turn Depot was made to store physical works, I wanted to show the park’s residents the diverse materials of contemporary art. Not a few of them reacted with, “Is this really supposed to be art…?” and sometimes the reactions were outright hostile.

In fact, since the project was called Love Your Depot, I had promised at the public hearing before it opened: if the people of the neighborhood didn’t love it, we would dismantle Gangnam Pavilion and remove it from the park. Feeling pressed, I once filled an exhibition entirely with paintings, and the next time I put works that clearly reproduced recognizable objects at the front so people could understand them immediately.

The highlight was a tangerine peel crafted so convincingly out of clay. Those two exhibitions produced the greatest number of complaint calls that Gangnam District Office ever had to field. “How much is that painting?” “I want to invest in the painting, tell me the price.” “How can that be art, clean up that trash.” When I switched back to works that were “hard to understand,” the complaints subsided.

In 2009, at twenty years old, Seok Da-seul in a drawing class once strung together a Coke tab, a bit of wire, and some other small thing I no longer remember, and held it up delicately between his fingers. He said it was a drawing he had done the day before.

I remember Henk Visch once leaning over my makeshift things and exclaiming with delight, “How on earth can you make something like this?!” A hand that transforms the trivial into the tender. Watching Seok Da-seul, I too thought, “How on earth…?”

Now as an artist, he makes objects like the emptied skins left after someone has eaten away the soft insides (like a mound of shells), or the organs of fragile, delicious creatures. Soon enough, another exclamation will surely come.
